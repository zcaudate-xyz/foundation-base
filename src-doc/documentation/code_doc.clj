"Elements are constructed using a tag and a map contained within double square brackets. Elements tags have been inspired from latex:
- [Content Elements](#content)
- [Sectioning Elements](#sections)
- [Code Elements](#code)

Clojure strings are treated as paragraph elements whilst clojure forms are treated as code elements. `fact` and `comment` forms are also considered code elements. Elements will be described in detail in their respective sections."

[[:section {:title "sections"}]]

"Sectioning elements are taken from latex and allow the document to be organised into logical sections. From highest to lowest order of priority, they are: `:chapter`, `section`, `subsection` and `:subsubsection`, giving four levels of organisation.

The numbering for elements are generated in sequencial order: `(1, 2, 3 ... etc)` and a tag can be generated from the title or specified for creating links within the document. `:chapter`, `section` and `subsection` elements are list in the table of contents using tags.

For example, I wish to write a chapter about animals and have organised content into categories shown below."
