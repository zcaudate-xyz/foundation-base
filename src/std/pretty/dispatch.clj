  "Dispatch functions take a `Class` argument and return the looked-up value.
  This provides similar functionality to Clojure's protocols, but operates over
  locally-constructed logic rather than using a global dispatch table.

  A simple example is a map from classes to values, which can be used directly
  as a lookup function."
