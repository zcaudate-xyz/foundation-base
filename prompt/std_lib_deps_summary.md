## std.lib.deps: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.deps` namespace provides a powerful and generic framework for managing dependencies between entities within a system. It's built around the `std.protocol.deps/IDeps` protocol, allowing any data structure that implements this protocol to be treated as a dependency graph. This module offers functionalities for resolving, ordering, constructing, and deconstructing entities based on their dependencies, as well as managing their lifecycle (adding, removing, refreshing, reloading).

### Core Concepts:

*   **`IDeps` Protocol:** The central abstraction for defining dependency-aware entities. It specifies methods for:
    *   `-get-entry`: Retrieves an entry by its ID.
    *   `-get-deps`: Returns the direct dependencies of an entity.
    *   `-list-entries`: Lists all entities in the context.
*   **`IDepsCompile`, `IDepsMutate`, `IDepsTeardown` Protocols:** These extend `IDeps` to provide more specific lifecycle and manipulation capabilities:
    *   `IDepsCompile`: For constructing entities in a dependency-aware order.
    *   `IDepsMutate`: For adding, removing, and refreshing entities.
    *   `IDepsTeardown`: For deconstructing entities in reverse dependency order.
*   **Dependency Graph:** Entities and their relationships form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is used for topological sorting and dependency resolution.

### Key Functions:

*   **`deps-map`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Creates a map where keys are entity IDs and values are their direct dependencies, based on the `IDeps` protocol.
    *   **Usage:** `(deps-map context [:id1 :id2])`
*   **`deps-resolve`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Recursively resolves all transitive dependencies for a given set of entities, returning a map containing all resolved entities and their full dependency graph.
    *   **Usage:** `(deps-resolve context [:id1])`
*   **`deps-ordered`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Returns a topologically sorted list of entities, ensuring that all dependencies appear before the entities that depend on them.
    *   **Usage:** `(deps-ordered context)` or `(deps-ordered context [:id1 :id2])`
*   **`construct`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Builds a collection of entities in dependency order, applying a step function for each entity. This is useful for initializing or setting up a system where components have interdependencies.
    *   **Usage:** `(construct context)` or `(construct context [:id1 :id2])`
*   **`deconstruct`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Deconstructs a collection of entities in reverse dependency order, applying a step function for each entity. This is useful for tearing down or cleaning up a system.
    *   **Usage:** `(deconstruct context acc [:id1 :id2])`
*   **`dependents-direct`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Returns the direct dependents of a given entity (i.e., entities that directly depend on it).
    *   **Usage:** `(dependents-direct context :some-id)`
*   **`dependents-topological`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Constructs a topological graph of dependents for a set of entities.
    *   **Usage:** `(dependents-topological context [:id1] [:all-ids])`
*   **`dependents-all`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Returns a graph of all transitive dependents for a given entity.
    *   **Usage:** `(dependents-all context :some-id)`
*   **`dependents-ordered`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Returns a topologically sorted list of all transitive dependents for a given entity.
    *   **Usage:** `(dependents-ordered context :some-id)`
*   **`dependents-refresh`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Refreshes an entity and all its dependents in the correct order.
    *   **Usage:** `(dependents-refresh context :some-id)`
*   **`unload-entry`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Unloads an entity and all entities that depend on it, in reverse dependency order.
    *   **Usage:** `(unload-entry context :some-id)`
*   **`reload-entry`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Unloads and then reloads an entity and all its dependents, ensuring a clean refresh.
    *   **Usage:** `(reload-entry context :some-id)`

### Usage Pattern:

This namespace is fundamental for managing complex systems where components have explicit dependencies. It's particularly useful in:
*   **Module/Plugin Systems:** Loading and unloading modules in the correct order.
*   **Configuration Management:** Applying configuration changes that affect interdependent parts of a system.
*   **Build Systems:** Orchestrating build steps where tasks depend on each other.
*   **Runtime Management:** Ensuring that language runtimes or other services are started and stopped in a consistent and safe manner.

By providing a robust and protocol-driven dependency management system, `std.lib.deps` enables the `foundation-base` project to handle the intricate relationships between its various components and language runtimes.
