# `xt.lang.base-lib` Recommendations

`xt.lang.base-lib` provides a solid foundation for cross-language development. Here are some recommendations for new functionality that could make it even more useful:

*   **More Collection Functions:**
    *   `map`, `filter`, `reduce`: These are fundamental higher-order functions for working with collections. Adding them to `xt.lang.base-lib` would make it much easier to write functional-style code in a cross-language way.
    *   `sort`, `sort-by`: For sorting collections.
    *   `group-by`: For grouping elements of a collection based on a key.
*   **More String Functions:**
    *   `trim`, `trim-left`, `trim-right`: For removing whitespace from strings.
    *   `pad-left`, `pad-right`: For padding strings to a certain length.
    *   `replace`: For replacing substrings.
*   **Date/Time Functions:**
    *   `now`: Returns the current time as a timestamp or a date object.
    *   `format-date`: Formats a date object into a string.
    *   `parse-date`: Parses a string into a date object.
*   **URL Functions:**
    *   `url-encode`, `url-decode`: For encoding and decoding URL components.
    *   `parse-url`: For parsing a URL into its components (protocol, host, path, etc.).
*   **Randomness:**
    *   `rand-int`: Generates a random integer within a given range.
    *   `rand-nth`: Returns a random element from a collection.
    *   `shuffle`: Shuffles the elements of a collection.
