## std.lib.io: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.io` namespace provides fundamental utilities for working with I/O operations in Clojure, primarily focusing on character sets and type predicates for various I/O stream and reader/writer types. It offers functions to query and manipulate character sets and to check the type of I/O-related objects.

**Key Features and Concepts:**

1.  **Character Set Utilities:**
    *   `charset:default`: Returns the default character set of the system (e.g., "UTF-8").
    *   `charset:list`: Provides a list of all available character set names on the system.
    *   `charset`: Constructs a `java.nio.charset.Charset` object from a given string name.

2.  **I/O Type Predicates:**
    *   `input-stream?`: Checks if an object is an instance of `java.io.InputStream`.
    *   `output-stream?`: Checks if an object is an instance of `java.io.OutputStream`.
    *   `reader?`: Checks if an object is an instance of `java.io.Reader`.
    *   `writer?`: Checks if an object is an instance of `java.io.Writer`.

**Usage and Importance:**

The `std.lib.io` module is a foundational component for any Clojure application that deals with file operations, network communication, or any form of data input/output. It provides basic tools for ensuring correct character encoding and for type-checking I/O objects, which can be crucial for robust and error-free I/O handling. While simple, these utilities are essential for building more complex I/O functionalities within the `foundation-base` project.
