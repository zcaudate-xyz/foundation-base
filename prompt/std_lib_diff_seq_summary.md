## std.lib.diff.seq: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.diff.seq` namespace provides functions for computing the difference between two sequences and applying those differences as a patch. It implements a variation of the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm, specifically Myers' diff algorithm, to generate an "edit script" that describes how to transform one sequence into another. This module is useful for tasks such as version control, synchronization, and displaying changes between ordered data.

### Core Concepts:

*   **Sequence Differencing:** The primary goal is to find the minimal set of insertions and deletions required to transform a source sequence into a target sequence.
*   **Edit Script:** The output of the `diff` function is an "edit script," which is a sequence of operations (`:+, :-, <number>`) describing the changes.
    *   `[:- index count]`: Delete `count` elements starting at `index`.
    *   `[:+ index elements]`: Insert `elements` at `index`.
    *   `<number>`: Skip `number` of matching elements.
*   **Patching:** The `patch` function takes a source sequence and an edit script and applies the operations to produce the target sequence.
*   **Myers' Diff Algorithm:** The underlying algorithm is an efficient way to compute the shortest edit script between two sequences.

### Key Functions:

*   **`diff`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Computes the difference between two sequences (`as` and `bs`) and returns a pair: `[distance edit-script]`. The `distance` is the number of edits (insertions/deletions) required.
    *   **Input:** Two sequences (`as`, `bs`).
    *   **Output:** `[d es]` where `d` is the edit distance and `es` is the edit script.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (diff [1 2 3 4 5] [1 2 :a 4 5])
        ;; => [2 [[:- 2 1] [:+ 2 [:a]]]]
        ;; (Delete 1 element at index 2, Insert [:a] at index 2)
        ```
*   **`patch`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Applies an edit script (generated by `diff`) to a source sequence to produce the target sequence.
    *   **Input:** A source sequence (`as`) and a `diff-result` (the output of `diff`).
    *   **Output:** The patched sequence.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (patch [1 2 3 4 5]
               [4 [[:- 1 1] [:+ 1 [:a]] [:- 3 1] [:+ 3 [2]]]])
        ;; => [1 :a 3 2 5]
        ```
*   **`insert-at` (private helper)**: Inserts a sequence of elements at a specific index in another sequence.
*   **`remove-at` (private helper)**: Removes `n` elements starting at a specific index from a sequence.
*   **`edits`, `distance`, `snake`, `step`, `diff*`, `swap-insdels` (private helpers)**: Internal functions that implement Myers' diff algorithm.

### Usage Pattern:

This namespace is valuable for scenarios where:
*   **Version Control:** Tracking changes in text files or structured data.
*   **Synchronization:** Reconciling differences between two versions of data.
*   **UI Updates:** Efficiently updating UI elements by only re-rendering changed parts of a list.
*   **Data Auditing:** Identifying precisely what has changed between two snapshots of sequential data.

By providing a robust and efficient sequence differencing and patching mechanism, `std.lib.diff.seq` offers a powerful tool for managing evolving ordered data.
