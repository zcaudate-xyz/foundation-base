## std.lib.version: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.version` namespace provides a robust set of tools for parsing, comparing, and managing software version strings. It supports a flexible versioning scheme (major.minor.patch-qualifier+build) and offers functions to determine if one version is newer, older, or equal to another. This module is crucial for conditional code execution, dependency management, and ensuring compatibility within the `foundation-base` project.

**Key Features and Concepts:**

1.  **Version String Parsing:**
    *   **`+pattern+`**: A regular expression used to parse version strings into their constituent parts (major, minor, patch, qualifier, build).
    *   **`+qualifiers+`**: A map defining the numerical order of common version qualifiers (e.g., "alpha", "beta", "rc", "final").
    *   **`+order+`**: A vector defining the order of precedence for version components during comparison.
    *   **`parse-number [s]`**: Parses a string into a `Long` number.
    *   **`parse-qualifier [release build]`**: Parses a version qualifier string into its numerical representation based on `+qualifiers+`.
    *   **`parse [s]`**: The core parsing function. It takes a version string `s` and returns a map containing its parsed components (e.g., `:major`, `:minor`, `:incremental`, `:qualifier`, `:release`, `:build`).

2.  **Version Object and Comparison:**
    *   **`version [x]`**: Converts a string or map into a standardized version map.
    *   **`order`**: A `juxt` function that extracts the ordered components of a version map for comparison.
    *   **`equal? [a b]`**: Compares two versions for equality, ignoring the `:release` string.
    *   **`newer? [a b]`**: Returns `true` if version `a` is newer than version `b`.
    *   **`older? [a b]`**: Returns `true` if version `a` is older than version `b`.
    *   **`not-equal? [a b]`**: Returns `true` if versions `a` and `b` are not equal (composed from `equal?`).
    *   **`not-newer? [a b]`**: Returns `true` if version `a` is not newer than version `b` (composed from `newer?`).
    *   **`not-older? [a b]`**: Returns `true` if version `a` is not older than version `b` (composed from `older?`).
    *   **`+lookup+`**: A map associating comparison keywords (e.g., `:newer`, `:older`) with their corresponding predicate functions.

3.  **System Version Information:**
    *   **`clojure-version []`**: Returns the current Clojure version as a parsed map.
    *   **`java-version []`**: Returns the current Java version as a parsed map.
    *   **`system-version [tag]`**: Returns the version of a system component (e.g., `:clojure`, `:java`) as a parsed map.

4.  **Constraint Checking and Conditional Execution:**
    *   **`satisfied [[type compare constraint] & [current]]`**: Checks if a `current` version satisfies a given `constraint` using a specified `compare` predicate (e.g., `:newer`, `:older`).
    *   **`init [constraints & statements]`**: A macro that conditionally executes `statements` (typically `(:import ...)` or `(:require ...)` forms) only if all `constraints` are satisfied by the current system versions. This is useful for loading version-specific code.
    *   **`run [constraints & body]`**: A macro that conditionally executes a `body` of code only if all `constraints` are satisfied by the current system versions.

**Usage and Importance:**

The `std.lib.version` module is essential for building robust and adaptable applications within the `foundation-base` project. Its key contributions include:

*   **Dependency Management:** Ensures that code is executed only when the required software versions (Clojure, Java, etc.) are met.
*   **Conditional Code Loading:** Allows for version-specific code paths, enabling compatibility with different environments or library versions.
*   **API Compatibility Checks:** Facilitates checking if a given API version is compatible with the current system.
*   **Automated Testing:** Can be used in test suites to ensure that code behaves as expected across different platform versions.
*   **Meta-programming:** Provides a programmatic way to reason about and react to version information, which is crucial for a project that generates and manages code for various targets.

By offering these comprehensive version management capabilities, `std.lib.version` significantly enhances the `foundation-base` project's ability to manage its complex, multi-language development ecosystem with greater reliability and adaptability.
