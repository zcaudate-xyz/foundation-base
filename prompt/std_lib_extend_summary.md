## std.lib.extend: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.extend` namespace provides utility functions and a macro to simplify the process of extending Clojure protocols to multiple types. It aims to reduce boilerplate when defining protocol implementations across various data structures, especially when the implementation logic is similar or can be templated.

**Key Features and Concepts:**

1.  **`extend-single [t proto ptmpls funcs]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Transforms a protocol template into a single `clojure.core/extend-type` expression.
    *   **Arguments**:
        *   `t`: The type (class) to which the protocol is being extended.
        *   `proto`: The protocol being extended.
        *   `ptmpls`: A list of protocol method templates. Each template is a form representing a method definition, where `%` acts as a placeholder for the actual implementation function.
        *   `funcs`: A list of functions that will replace the `%` placeholders in the `ptmpls`.
    *   **Mechanism**: It uses `std.lib.walk/prewalk-replace` to substitute the placeholder `%` in the method templates with the provided implementation functions.

2.  **`extend-entry [proto ptmpls [ts funcs]]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A helper function for `extend-all`. It takes a protocol, its method templates, and a pair `[ts funcs]` where `ts` can be a single type or a vector of types, and `funcs` are the implementation functions for those types.
    *   **Mechanism**: It calls `extend-single` for each type in `ts`, generating the appropriate `extend-type` expressions.

3.  **`extend-all [proto ptmpls & args]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A macro that simplifies extending a protocol to multiple types with potentially different implementation functions. It reduces the verbosity of writing multiple `extend-type` forms.
    *   **Arguments**:
        *   `proto`: The protocol to extend.
        *   `ptmpls`: A list of protocol method templates (same as in `extend-single`).
        *   `& args`: A variadic argument list where each pair consists of a type (or a vector of types) and a list of corresponding implementation functions.
    *   **Mechanism**: It partitions the `args` into pairs of `[types functions]` and then uses `extend-entry` to generate a sequence of `extend-type` expressions, which are then wrapped in a `do` block.

**Usage and Importance:**

The `std.lib.extend` module is valuable for promoting code reuse and reducing boilerplate when working with Clojure protocols, especially in a large codebase like `foundation-base` where many types might implement similar protocol behaviors.

*   **Reduced Boilerplate**: Instead of writing `extend-type` repeatedly for each type, `extend-all` allows for a more concise and declarative way to define multiple extensions.
*   **Templated Implementations**: The use of `ptmpls` and placeholders (`%`) enables the definition of generic implementation patterns that can be reused across different types, with only the specific functions changing.
*   **Improved Readability**: By abstracting away the repetitive structure of `extend-type`, the code becomes cleaner and easier to understand.
*   **Facilitates Protocol-Oriented Design**: Encourages the use of protocols by making their implementation less cumbersome, thereby supporting a more flexible and extensible architecture.

This module contributes to the overall maintainability and development efficiency of the `foundation-base` project by streamlining the process of extending protocols to various data types.
