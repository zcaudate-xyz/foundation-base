## std.lib.collection: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.collection` namespace provides a rich set of utility functions for working with Clojure's core data structures (maps, sequences, vectors, sets). It extends the functionality of `clojure.core` with specialized operations for nested data manipulation, key/value transformations, sequence processing, and advanced map differencing and patching. This module aims to simplify common collection-related tasks and provide more powerful tools for data transformation.

### Core Concepts:

*   **Collection Predicates:** Functions to check the type of various collections (e.g., `hash-map?`, `lazy-seq?`, `cons?`, `form?`).
*   **Sequence Utilities:** Functions for manipulating sequences, including `seqify`, `unseqify`, `unlazy`, `insert-at`, `remove-at`, `deduped?`, and `unfold`.
*   **Map Transformations:** Extensive functions for transforming map keys, values, and entries, including `map-keys`, `map-vals`, `map-juxt`, `map-entries`, `pmap-vals`, `pmap-entries`, `rename-keys`, `filter-keys`, `filter-vals`, `keep-vals`, `transpose`.
*   **Namespaced Key Handling:** Utilities for working with namespaced keywords in maps, such as `qualified-keys`, `unqualified-keys`, `qualify-keys`, `unqualify-keys`.
*   **Nested Map Operations:** Powerful functions for merging, associating, and disassociating values in nested maps, including `merge-nested`, `merge-nested-new`, `dissoc-nested`, `flatten-nested`, `tree-flatten`, `tree-nestify`, `tree-nestify:all`.
*   **Map Differencing and Patching:** A sophisticated set of functions (`diff`, `diff:changes`, `diff:new`, `diff:changed`, `diff:patch`, `diff:unpatch`) for comparing two maps, identifying differences, and applying/reverting patches.
*   **Data Transformation Pipelines:** Functions like `reshape` and `transform` (with `find-templates`) for defining and applying complex data transformations based on schemas or templates.

### Key Functions:

*   **`hash-map?`, `lazy-seq?`, `cons?`, `form?`**: Predicates for checking collection types.
*   **`queue`**: Creates a `clojure.lang.PersistentQueue`.
*   **`seqify`, `unseqify`**: Convert non-sequences to sequences and vice-versa.
*   **`unlazy`**: Forces evaluation of a lazy sequence.
*   **`map-keys`, `map-vals`, `map-juxt`, `map-entries`**: Apply functions to map keys, values, or entries. `pmap-vals` and `pmap-entries` provide parallel versions.
*   **`rename-keys`**: Renames keys in a map based on a mapping.
*   **`filter-keys`, `filter-vals`, `keep-vals`**: Filter map entries based on keys or values.
*   **`qualified-keys`, `unqualified-keys`, `qualify-keys`, `unqualify-keys`**: Manipulate namespaced keywords in maps.
*   **`assoc-new`**: Associates a key-value pair only if the key is not already present or its value is `nil`.
*   **`merge-nested`, `merge-nested-new`**: Recursively merge nested maps. `merge-nested-new` only merges if the target key doesn't exist.
*   **`dissoc-nested`**: Recursively disassociates keys from nested maps, removing empty intermediate maps.
*   **`flatten-nested`**: Flattens all elements of a collection into a single sequence.
*   **`tree-flatten`, `tree-nestify`, `tree-nestify:all`**: Convert between flat (path-based keys) and nested map representations.
*   **`reshape`**: Moves values within a map according to a specified transformation table.
*   **`find-templates`, `transform-fn`, `transform`**: Tools for defining and applying data transformations using template strings.
*   **`empty-record`**: Creates an empty instance of a `defrecord`.
*   **`transpose`**: Swaps keys and values in a map.
*   **`index-at`, `element-at`**: Find the index or element matching a predicate in a collection.
*   **`insert-at`, `remove-at`**: Insert or remove elements at a specific index in a vector.
*   **`deduped?`**: Checks if all elements in a collection are unique.
*   **`unfold`**: Generates a sequence by repeatedly applying a function to a seed value.
*   **`diff`, `diff:changes`, `diff:new`, `diff:changed`, `diff:patch`, `diff:unpatch`**: Functions for computing differences between nested maps and applying/reverting those differences.

### Usage Pattern:

This namespace is a utility belt for any Clojure project that deals heavily with data manipulation. It's particularly valuable for:
*   **Configuration Management:** Merging and transforming configuration maps.
*   **State Management:** Efficiently updating and tracking changes in complex application state.
*   **Data Processing Pipelines:** Building transformations for data flowing through an application.
*   **API Development:** Reshaping data structures for different API endpoints or external systems.
*   **Metaprogramming:** Manipulating data structures that represent code or schemas.

By providing these powerful and often recursive collection utilities, `std.lib.collection` significantly enhances Clojure's already strong data-oriented programming capabilities.
