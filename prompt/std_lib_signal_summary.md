## std.lib.signal: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.signal` namespace provides a flexible and extensible event signaling system, allowing for decoupled communication between different parts of an application. It enables handlers to register for specific events (signals) based on a checker function or data pattern, and then dispatches these events to all matching handlers. This module is crucial for building reactive and modular systems where components need to respond to various events without direct coupling.

**Key Features and Concepts:**

1.  **Signal Data and Matching:**
    *   **`new-id []`**: Generates a new unique keyword ID, typically used for handlers.
    *   **`expand-data [data]`**: Expands shorthand signal data (keywords, vectors) into a standardized map format (e.g., `:hello` -> `{:hello true}`).
    *   **`check-data [data chk]`**: A powerful function for matching signal `data` against a `chk` (checker). `chk` can be:
        *   A map: All key-value pairs in `chk` must match in `data`.
        *   A vector: All elements in the vector must match `data`.
        *   A function/keyword: `chk` is applied to `data`.
        *   A set: Any element in `chk` must match `data`.
        *   `'_`: Matches any data.

2.  **Signal Manager:**
    *   **`Manager` Record**: The core record for managing signal handlers. It contains:
        *   `id`: A unique ID for the manager.
        *   `store`: A vector of registered handlers.
        *   `options`: A map of manager options.
    *   **`manager [& [id store options]]`**: Creates a new `Manager` instance.
    *   **`*manager*`**: A dynamic var (atom) holding the default global `Manager` instance.

3.  **Handler Management:**
    *   **`remove-handler [manager id]`**: Removes a handler by its `id` from the `manager`.
    *   **`add-handler [manager checker handler]`**: Adds a `handler` to the `manager`. A `handler` can be a function or a map containing a `:fn` and a `:checker`. If no `id` is provided, a new one is generated.
    *   **`list-handlers [manager & [checker]]`**: Lists all handlers in a `manager`, optionally filtered by a `checker`.
    *   **`match-handlers [manager data]`**: Returns a list of handlers from the `manager` whose `checker` matches the given `data`.

4.  **Global Signal API:**
    *   **`signal:clear []`**: Clears all handlers from the global `*manager*`.
    *   **`signal:list [& [checker]]`**: Lists handlers from the global `*manager*`.
    *   **`signal:install [id checker handler]`**: Installs a handler into the global `*manager*`.
    *   **`signal:uninstall [id]`**: Uninstalls a handler from the global `*manager*`. It also attempts to unmap the var if `id` is a symbol representing a var.
    *   **`signal [data & [manager]]`**: The core function to signal an event. It expands the `data`, finds all matching handlers in the `manager` (or global `*manager*`), and executes their `:fn` with the expanded data.

5.  **Testing Utility:**
    *   **`signal:with-temp [[checker handler] & body]`**: A macro that temporarily binds `*manager*` to a new `Manager` instance, installs a temporary handler, and then executes `body`. This is useful for isolated testing of signal handlers.

**Overall Importance:**

The `std.lib.signal` module is a crucial component for building event-driven and loosely coupled systems within the `foundation-base` project. Its key contributions include:

*   **Decoupled Communication:** Allows components to communicate through events without direct dependencies, improving modularity and maintainability.
*   **Flexible Event Matching:** The `check-data` function provides a powerful and extensible mechanism for handlers to specify which events they are interested in.
*   **Dynamic Handler Management:** Handlers can be installed and uninstalled at runtime, enabling dynamic system behavior and hot-swapping of event responses.
*   **Centralized Event Dispatch:** The `Manager` and `signal` function provide a centralized point for event dispatch, making it easier to trace and debug event flows.
*   **Testability:** `signal:with-temp` facilitates isolated testing of event handlers.

By offering these robust event signaling capabilities, `std.lib.signal` significantly enhances the `foundation-base` project's ability to build complex, reactive, and extensible applications, which is vital for its multi-language development ecosystem.
