## std.lib.diff: A Comprehensive Summary

The `std.lib.diff` module, specifically through its `std.lib.diff.seq` sub-namespace, provides a robust implementation of the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm for computing differences between two sequences. It offers functions to generate a "diff" (edit script) that describes how to transform one sequence into another, and to apply these diffs to sequences. This module is fundamental for tasks requiring version control, change tracking, or reconciliation of sequential data.

The module is primarily composed of the `std.lib.diff.seq` namespace:

### `std.lib.diff.seq`

This namespace implements the core diffing and patching logic for sequences.

*   **Concepts:**
    *   **`fp`**: A map representing "furthest points" on a diagonal `k`, storing the furthest distance `d` reached and the sequence of edit operations (`edits`) to get there.
    *   **`as`, `bs`**: Arbitrary sequences that support equality comparison.
    *   **`av`, `bv`**: Vector versions of `as` and `bs` for optimized `count` and `nth` access.
*   **Internal Helper Functions:**
    *   `edits [fp k]`: Retrieves the edit operations for a given diagonal `k` from the `fp` map.
    *   `distance [fp k]`: Retrieves the furthest distance `d` for a given diagonal `k` from the `fp` map.
    *   `snake [av bv fp k]`: Advances along a diagonal `k` as long as corresponding items in `av` and `bv` match, extending the furthest distance and recording edit operations.
    *   `step [av bv delta [fp p]]`: Computes the next set of furthest points (`fp`) and increments the path length `p` for the diff algorithm.
    *   `diff* [av bv]`: The core diffing algorithm, which assumes `(count av) >= (count bv)` and returns the distance and edit operations.
    *   `swap-insdels [[d edits]]`: Swaps the `:+` and `:-` edit operation symbols, used when the input sequences are swapped for `diff*`.
    *   `editscript [av bv edits]`: Converts the raw edit operations from `diff*` into a more structured edit script, indicating insertions (`:+`), deletions (`:-`), and skips (numbers).
*   **`diff [as bs]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Computes the difference between two sequences `as` and `bs`.
    *   **Output**: Returns a pair `[distance editscript]`, where `distance` is the minimum number of edits (insertions or deletions) required to transform `as` into `bs`, and `editscript` is a sequence of operations.
    *   **Edit Script Format**: Each operation in `editscript` is a vector:
        *   `[:- index count]`: Delete `count` items from `as` starting at `index`.
        *   `[:+ index items]`: Insert `items` into `as` at `index`.
        *   `number`: Skip `number` items (they are common to both sequences).
*   **Internal Helper Functions for Patching:**
    *   `insert-at [xs i ys]`: Inserts sequence `ys` into `xs` at position `i`.
    *   `remove-at [xs i & [n]]`: Removes `n` items (default 1) from `xs` at position `i`.
*   **`patch [as diff-result]`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Applies a `diff-result` (obtained from `diff`) to an original sequence `as` to produce the revised sequence.
    *   **Flexibility**: Can optionally take custom `insert-f` and `remove-f` functions for specialized patching behavior.

**Usage and Importance:**

The `std.lib.diff` module is a powerful tool for any application within the `foundation-base` project that needs to track or reconcile changes in sequential data. Its applications include:

*   **Version Control Systems:** Fundamental for identifying changes between different versions of code or documents.
*   **Text Editors and IDEs:** Highlighting differences in files.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Reconciling discrepancies between two datasets.
*   **Code Generation and Transformation:** Understanding how generated code differs from a previous version.
*   **Testing:** Comparing expected output sequences with actual output.

By providing a robust and efficient diffing and patching mechanism, `std.lib.diff` contributes significantly to the `foundation-base` project's capabilities in managing and understanding changes across its various components and generated artifacts.
