# `std.lib` Recommendations

Here are some recommendations for new functionality in the broader `std.lib` codebase. These suggestions aim to fill in some common gaps in a foundational library and would make the `foundation-base` ecosystem more self-contained and powerful.

*   **`std.lib.json`:**
    *   **Justification:** JSON is the de-facto standard for data interchange on the web. A dedicated namespace for JSON operations would be extremely valuable for any part of the system that needs to interact with web services or read/write configuration files.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   `encode`: Serializes a Clojure data structure to a JSON string.
        *   `decode`: Parses a JSON string into a Clojure data structure.
        *   Support for custom encoders/decoders for custom data types.
        *   Functions for working with JSON schemas for validation.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.json :as json])

        (def my-map {:a 1 :b "hello"})
        (def json-string (json/encode my-map))
        ;; => "{\"a\":1,\"b\":\"hello\"}"

        (json/decode json-string)
        ;; => {:a 1, :b "hello"}
        ```

*   **`std.lib.http`:**
    *   **Justification:** Many modern applications need to communicate with other services over HTTP. A built-in HTTP client would simplify this greatly, providing a consistent API for making requests and handling responses.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   Functions for all standard HTTP methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch`.
        *   Easy ways to set headers, query parameters, and request bodies.
        *   Automatic parsing of response bodies (e.g., JSON).
        *   Support for both synchronous and asynchronous requests (leveraging `std.lib.future`).
        *   Connection pooling for performance.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.http :as http])

        (def response (http/get "https://api.example.com/users/1"))
        (:body response)
        ;; => {:id 1, :name "John Doe"}
        ```

*   **`std.lib.csv`:**
    *   **Justification:** CSV is a common format for data import/export. A library for handling CSV files would be useful for data processing tasks.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   `read-csv`: Reads a CSV file into a sequence of maps or vectors.
        *   `write-csv`: Writes a sequence of maps or vectors to a CSV file.
        *   Options for specifying delimiters, quote characters, and headers.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.csv :as csv])

        (def data [{:name "John", :age 30} {:name "Jane", :age 25}])
        (csv/write-csv "users.csv" data)

        (csv/read-csv "users.csv")
        ;; => [{:name "John", :age "30"}, {:name "Jane", :age "25"}]
        ```

*   **`std.lib.xml`:**
    *   **Justification:** While less common than JSON, XML is still used in many enterprise systems and for configuration files. An XML parsing and generation library would be a valuable addition.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   `parse`: Parses an XML string or file into a Clojure data structure (e.g., a nested map).
        *   `emit`: Emits a Clojure data structure as an XML string.
        *   Support for namespaces and attributes.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.xml :as xml])

        (def xml-string "<user><name>John</name></user>")
        (xml/parse xml-string)
        ;; => {:tag :user, :content [{:tag :name, :content ["John"]}]}
        ```

*   **`std.lib.crypto`:**
    *   **Justification:** `std.lib.security` provides a good foundation, but a more comprehensive and higher-level cryptography library would be beneficial for applications with more advanced security requirements.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   Symmetric encryption with common algorithms like AES-GCM.
        *   Asymmetric encryption with RSA and EC.
        *   Digital signatures with RSA and ECDSA.
        *   Password hashing with algorithms like bcrypt or scrypt.
        *   Key derivation functions.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.crypto :as crypto])

        (def hashed-password (crypto/hash-password "my-secret-password"))
        (crypto/verify-password "my-secret-password" hashed-password)
        ;; => true
        ```

*   **`std.lib.stats`:**
    *   **Justification:** For applications that need to perform data analysis or monitoring, a basic statistics library would be very helpful.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   `mean`, `median`, `mode`: For calculating measures of central tendency.
        *   `variance`, `stdev`: For calculating measures of dispersion.
        *   `percentiles`, `quartiles`: For understanding the distribution of data.
        *   `correlation`: For measuring the relationship between two variables.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.stats :as stats])

        (def numbers [1 2 3 4 5])
        (stats/mean numbers)
        ;; => 3
        (stats/stdev numbers)
        ;; => 1.58...
        ```

*   **`std.lib.date`:**
    *   **Justification:** `std.lib.time` is good for low-level time measurements, but a more feature-rich date and time library is needed for many applications.
    *   **Recommended Functionality:**
        *   Support for time zones.
        *   Date and time arithmetic (e.g., adding/subtracting days, months, years).
        *   Parsing and formatting dates and times in various formats (e.g., ISO 8601).
        *   Functions for working with date ranges and intervals.
    *   **Example Usage:**
        ```clojure
        (require '[std.lib.date :as d])

        (def now (d/now))
        (def tomorrow (d/plus now (d/days 1)))
        (d/format tomorrow "yyyy-MM-dd")
        ```
