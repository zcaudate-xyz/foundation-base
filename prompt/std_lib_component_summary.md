## std.lib.component: A Comprehensive Summary (including std.lib.component.track)

The `std.lib.component` namespace, along with its sub-namespace `std.lib.component.track`, provides a robust and extensible framework for managing the lifecycle of components in Clojure applications. It introduces a protocol-based approach for defining start/stop/kill operations, querying component status, and tracking component instances. This module is crucial for building modular, testable, and maintainable systems, especially in complex applications with many interconnected parts.

### `std.lib.component` (Component Lifecycle Management)

This namespace defines the core `std.protocol.component/IComponent` protocol and provides functions for interacting with components that implement it. It focuses on the lifecycle (start, stop, kill) and introspection (info, health, properties) of components.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **`IComponent` Protocol:** The central abstraction for defining components. It specifies the following methods:
    *   `-start`: Initializes and starts the component.
    *   `-stop`: Shuts down and cleans up the component.
    *   `-kill`: Forcefully terminates the component (potentially without graceful shutdown).
    *   `-info`: Returns information about the component at a given level of detail.
    *   `-health`: Returns the health status of the component.
    *   `-remote?`: Indicates if the component connects to a remote resource.
    *   `-get-options`: Retrieves component-specific options.
    *   `-props`: Returns a map of component properties with getter/setter functions.
*   **Lifecycle Hooks:** Components can define `setup` and `teardown` functions, as well as `pre-start`, `post-start`, `pre-stop`, `post-stop` hooks, allowing for flexible initialization and cleanup.
*   **Tracking Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with `std.lib.component.track` to automatically track component instances.

**Key Functions:**

*   **`component?`**: Checks if an object implements the `IComponent` protocol.
*   **`started?`**: Checks if a component is in a started state.
*   **`stopped?`**: Checks if a component is in a stopped state.
*   **`start`**: Initiates the component's lifecycle, running pre-start hooks, the `-start` method, setup functions, and post-start hooks. It also tracks the component.
*   **`stop`**: Halts the component's lifecycle, running pre-stop hooks, teardown functions, the `-stop` method, and post-stop hooks. It also untracks the component.
*   **`kill`**: Forcefully stops a component, setting a dynamic flag `*kill*` to `true` before calling `stop`.
*   **`info`**: Retrieves information about the component.
*   **`health`**: Returns the health status of the component (e.g., `:ok`, `:errored`).
*   **`remote?`**: Checks if the component interacts with remote resources.
*   **`all-props`, `get-prop`, `set-prop`**: Functions for inspecting and manipulating component properties defined via the `-props` method.
*   **`with` (macro)**: A convenient macro for ensuring a component is started before a block of code executes and stopped afterwards, similar to `with-open`.
*   **`wrap-start`, `wrap-stop`**: Higher-order functions to add additional setup/teardown steps to the start/stop process, useful for extending runtime behavior.

### `std.lib.component.track` (Component Instance Tracking)

This sub-namespace provides a global registry for tracking component instances, allowing for introspection, management, and debugging of active components across the application.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **`ITrack` Protocol:** Components can implement this protocol to define a `track-path` (a vector of keywords) where they should be registered in the global `*registry*`.
*   **Global Registry (`*registry*`):** An atom holding a nested map that stores `TrackEntry` records for all tracked components.
*   **`TrackEntry`:** A record that stores metadata about a tracked component, including its creation time, namespace, and the component instance itself.
*   **Actions:** A mechanism to define and apply functions to tracked components (e.g., `stop`, `start`, `println`).

**Key Functions:**

*   **`track-path`**: Retrieves the tracking path for a trackable object.
*   **`trackable?`**: Checks if an object implements the `ITrack` protocol.
*   **`track`**: Registers a component in the global registry. It assigns a unique ID (`track/id`) to the component if it doesn't have one.
*   **`tracked?`**: Checks if a component instance is currently being tracked.
*   **`untrack`**: Removes a component instance from the global registry.
*   **`untrack-all`**: Clears all or a subset of tracked components from the registry.
*   **`tracked:action:add`, `tracked:action:remove`, `tracked:action:get`, `tracked:action:list`**: Functions for managing a global map of named actions that can be performed on tracked components.
*   **`tracked:all`**: Returns the entire `*registry*` or a sub-section of it.
*   **`tracked`**: Applies a specified action (function) to all components found at a given path in the registry.
*   **`tracked:count`**: Returns the count of tracked components at a given path.
*   **`tracked:locate`**: Finds tracked components that match specific metadata.
*   **`tracked:list`**: Returns a list of tracked components, optionally applying an action to each.
*   **`tracked:last`**: Retrieves the `n` most recently tracked components at a given path.
*   **`track:with-metadata` (macro)**: Binds additional metadata to be associated with components tracked within its scope.

### Usage Pattern:

The `std.lib.component` module is fundamental for:
*   **Application Architecture:** Structuring applications into manageable, independent components.
*   **Testing:** Easily starting and stopping components for isolated testing.
*   **Monitoring and Debugging:** Gaining insight into the state and health of running components.
*   **Resource Management:** Ensuring proper allocation and deallocation of resources.

The `std.lib.component.track` submodule enhances this by providing a centralized, dynamic view of all active components, enabling powerful runtime introspection and control, which is particularly valuable in long-running or complex systems.

```clojure
;; Example of a component
(defrecord Database []
  std.protocol.track/ITrack
  (-track-path [db] [:my-app :database])

  std.protocol.component/IComponent
  (-start [db] (assoc db :status "started"))
  (-stop [db] (dissoc db :status))
  (-health [db] {:status :ok}))

;; Usage
(require '[std.lib.component :as comp])
(require '[std.lib.component.track :as track])

(def db-instance (-> (Database.) comp/start))
;; db-instance is now tracked and started

(comp/health db-instance)
;; => {:status :ok}

(track/tracked [:my-app :database] comp/info)
;; => {:my-app {:database {<uuid> {:info true, :status "started"}}}}

(comp/stop db-instance)
;; db-instance is now stopped and untracked
```
