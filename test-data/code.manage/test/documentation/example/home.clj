"In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb.
Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was
novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary
Web pages as the interface.

A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as
far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea
to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the
Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.

Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming
language called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp,
which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs."

"Eric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among
 other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests
 starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will
 also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi
 scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker should consider learning Lisp:

Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you
 finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your
 days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won't get you a job,
except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a
better writer in languages you do want to use, like English.

But wait a minute. This metaphor doesn't stretch that far. The reason Latin won't get
you a job is that no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you.
But Lisp is a computer language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to.

So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't you want to use it?
If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me
that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is
pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional
wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.

Why not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better
programs, you should use it. And if it doesn't, then who needs it?

This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone
to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all
 other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you're starting
 a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition.
 You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology,
 your competitors will crush you.

Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts
 and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.
 But we also knew that that didn't mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you'd
 be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are
 doing, and consider only what will work the best.

This is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other
big companies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. I don't
 think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.

The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you're running a big
company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect
to do as well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.

The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do everything
the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem
here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. The survival rate for
startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you're running a startup, you had better
be doing something odd. If not, you're in trouble.

Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few
understand even now: when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers,
you can use any language you want. When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong
bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years
ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software,
especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system,
you can use whatever language you want.

This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you
have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed
risk finding that their competitors do not.

If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious
that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch,
so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big
advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and
server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release
software the minute it's done.

If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological
edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience
in business. We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or
getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only
thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could
get in the software department, we would take.

So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our
software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to
do things in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't
need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a
better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users,
and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped
would happen, anyway.

What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had
many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could
compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt
like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of
them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that
we didn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate
a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time
journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.

It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were
decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was
simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able
to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.

When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick
Forsyth. The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. The
assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president's
route. He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.

Our secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre
syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But now
it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage
your competitors don't understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.

And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were
working on Viaweb. We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site,
all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio. This was no accident. A startup should give
its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn't know what language our software
was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2]

The people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn't care what language
Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them build great
looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got more and more
users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we had 500. Six months
later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to
dominate its market. It's one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it
are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping. I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users
they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000."
