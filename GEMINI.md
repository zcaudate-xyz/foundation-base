## Clojure Style Guide for `foundation-base`

This guide is based on the conventions observed in the `src/` directory of the `foundation-base` project. The goal is to maintain a consistent, readable, and idiomatic codebase that leverages Clojure's strengths, especially its macro system and functional programming paradigms, while also accommodating multi-platform code generation via `std.lang`.

### 1. Naming Conventions

Naming is a crucial part of writing clean, understandable code. The following conventions are used throughout the project.

#### 1.1. Files and Namespaces

*   **File Names:** File names use `spinal-case`.
    *   *Example:* `collection.clj`, `future.clj`, `emit_common.clj`

*   **Namespaces:** Namespaces follow the directory structure and use dots to separate components. The general pattern is `std.lib.<file-name>` or `std.lang.base.<sub-directory>.<file-name>`.
    *   *Example:* `std.lib.collection`, `std.lang.base.emit-common`

#### 1.2. Functions

*   **Public Functions:** Public functions use `spinal-case`.
    *   *Example:* `apply-in`, `swap-return!`, `create-directory`

*   **Namespaced Functions:** For groups of related functions within a single namespace, a colon (`:`) is used to create a "sub-namespace". This improves organization and readability.
    *   *Example:* `atom:get`, `atom:set`, `socket:port`, `res:spec-add`

*   **Predicate Functions:** Functions that return a boolean value should end with a question mark `?`.
    *   *Example:* `component?`, `started?`, `primitive?`, `hash-map?`, `qml-props?`

*   **Internal/Helper Functions:** Internal or helper functions that are not intended for public use often start with a hyphen (`-`) or are not explicitly exposed in the `ns` declaration.
    *   *Example:* `-write-value`, `tf-macroexpand`, `qml-props?`

#### 1.3. Variables and Constants

*   **Dynamic Variables:** Dynamic variables (those that can be rebound) follow the Clojure convention of using "earmuffs" (asterisks around the name).
    *   *Example:* `*registry*`, `*kill*`, `*current*`, `*macro-form*`

*   **Constants:** Constants or configuration values are denoted by surrounding the name with plus signs `+`.
    *   *Example:* `+primitives+`, `+hex-array+`, `+default-config+`, `+op-math+`

#### 1.4. Protocols, Records, and Types

*   **Protocols:** Protocols are defined in `CamelCase` and are prefixed with an `I`.
    *   *Example:* `IComponent`, `IApplicable`, `IString`, `IElement`

*   **Records and Types:** Records and types, often defined with `defimpl` or `defrecord`, are written in `CamelCase`.
    *   *Example:* `HostApplicative`, `Result`, `Link`, `Zipper`, `Image`, `Schema`, `Trace`, `NotifyServer`

### 2. Code Structure and Formatting

#### 2.1. Namespace Declarations

*   All `require` statements should be at the top of the file, immediately after the `ns` declaration.
*   Use aliases for required namespaces to keep the code clean and concise.
*   `(:refer-clojure :exclude [...])` is used to avoid name clashes with Clojure's built-in functions.

```clojure
(ns std.lib.apply
  (:require [std.protocol.apply  :as protocol.apply]
            [std.lib.foundation :as h]
            [std.lib.future :as f]
            [std.lib.return :as r]
            [std.lib.impl :refer [defimpl] :as impl]))
```

#### 2.2. Function Definitions

*   Public functions should have a docstring (`"..."`) explaining their purpose, arguments, and return value.
*   Use the `{:added "version"}` metadata to indicate when a function was introduced.
*   For functions with multiple arities, each arity should be clearly defined.

```clojure
(defn apply-in
  "runs the applicative within a context
 
   (apply-in (host-applicative {:form '+})
             nil
             [1 2 3 4 5])
   => 15"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([app rt args]
   (let [input  (protocol.apply/-transform-in app rt args)
         output (protocol.apply/-apply-in app rt input)]
     (r/return-chain output (partial protocol.apply/-transform-out app rt args)))))
```

#### 2.3. Metadata

Metadata is used extensively to provide additional information about functions, macros, and variables. Common metadata keys include:

*   `{:added "version"}`: Indicates when the function/macro was added.
*   `{:refer ...}`: Used in tests to link to the function being tested.
*   `{:style/indent N}`: Specifies indentation for macros.
*   `{:macro-only true}`: For `std.lang` scripts, indicates the file contains only macros.
*   `{:static ...}`: Used in `std.lang` for static analysis or configuration.
*   `{:rt/redis ...}`: Specific to Redis runtime configurations.

#### 2.4. Polymorphism

*   The `defimpl` macro is the preferred way to create new types and records that implement one or more protocols.
*   Use `extend-protocol` or `extend-type` when extending existing types.
*   `defmulti` and `defmethod` are used for extensible functions based on dispatch values.

```clojure
(defimpl HostApplicative
  [function form async]
  :prefix   "host-"
  :invoke   invoke-as
  :protocols [std.protocol.apply/IApplicable
              :body {-apply-default  nil
                     -transform-in   args
                     -transform-out  return}])

(defmulti map->key
  "transforms a map into a key"
  {:added "3.0"}
  (fn [{:keys [mode]}] mode))

(defmethod map->key :default
  ([{:keys [type encoded]}]
   (SecretKeySpec. (to-bytes encoded) type)))
```

### 3. `std.lang` DSL for Multi-Platform Development

The `foundation-base` project heavily leverages a custom DSL provided by `std.lang` for writing code that can be compiled to multiple target languages (e.g., JavaScript, Lua, Python, R, SQL, Solidity). This DSL has its own conventions that differ significantly from standard Clojure.

#### 3.1. Script Definition

*   **`l/script`:** All platform-specific code must be defined within an `(l/script <lang> ...)` block. The `:lang` keyword specifies the target language.
*   **`l/script-`:** Used in test files for setting up platform-specific test environments.

```clojure
(l/script :js
  {:require [[xt.lang.base-lib :as k]]
   :export [MODULE]})

(l/script :lua
  {:runtime :basic
   :config {:program :resty}
   :require [[xt.lang.base-lib :as k]]})
```

#### 3.2. Function and Variable Definitions

*   **`defn.<lang>`:** Functions intended for a specific target language are defined using `defn.js`, `defn.lua`, `defn.py`, `defn.r`, `defn.pg`, etc.
*   **`def.<lang>`:** Variables for a specific target language are defined using `def.js`, `def.lua`, etc.
*   **`def$.<lang>`:** Used for defining global variables in the target language.

```clojure
(defn.js my-function
  [x]
  (k/identity x))

(def.lua K_GROUP "__group__")

(def$.js GLTFLoader
  (. ThreeGLTF GLTFLoader))
```

#### 3.3. Macros for Code Generation

*   **`defmacro.<lang>`:** Macros specific to a target language are defined using `defmacro.js`, `defmacro.lua`, etc.
*   **`h/template-entries`:** This macro is used to generate multiple definitions from a template, often for binding external library functions or constants.

```clojure
(defmacro.js newOSC
  "creates a new OSC instance"
  {:added "4.0"}
  [& [m]]
  (list 'new 'OSC m))

(h/template-entries [l/tmpl-entry {:type :fragment
                                   :base "ValtioCore"
                                   :tag "js"}]
  [getVersion
   proxy
   [proxyRef ref]
   snapshot
   subscribe])
```

#### 3.4. Cross-Platform Utilities (`xt.lang.base-lib`)

*   The `xt.lang.base-lib` namespace (aliased as `k`) provides a set of cross-platform utility functions that should be used whenever possible to ensure consistency across target languages.
    *   *Example:* `k/obj-keys`, `k/arr-map`, `k/identity`

#### 3.5. Platform-Specific Execution in Tests

*   **`!.<platform>`:** In test files, `!.<platform>` (e.g., `!.js`, `!.lua`, `!.py`, `!.r`) is used to execute a form directly in the context of the specified target language's runtime.

```clojure
(fact "identity function works on all platforms"
  (!.js (k/identity 1))
  => 1

  (!.lua (k/identity 1))
  => 1)
```

### 4. Component-based Architecture

The project extensively uses a component-based architecture for managing application lifecycle and resources.

*   **`std.protocol.component/IComponent`:** The core protocol for defining components.
*   **`component/start`, `component/stop`, `component/kill`:** Standard functions for managing component lifecycle.
*   **`std.lib.resource`:** Provides a registry and management system for various resources.
    *   `res:spec-add`: Registers a new resource specification.
    *   `res:create`: Creates a new resource instance.
    *   `res:start`, `res:stop`: Manages the lifecycle of registered resources.

```clojure
(defimpl LuceneSearch [type instance]
  :string common/to-string
  :protocols [std.protocol.component/IComponent
              :body {-start impl/start-lucene
                     -stop  impl/stop-lucene}])

(res:spec-add
 {:type :hara/lang.library
  :mode {:allow #{:global}
         :default :global}
  :instance {:create #'lib/library:create
             :start h/start
             :stop h/stop}})
```

### 5. Concurrency and Asynchronicity

The `std.concurrent` and `std.lib.future` namespaces are used for managing concurrent operations and asynchronous workflows.

*   **`h/future`:** Creates a `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous execution.
*   **`f/on:complete`, `f/on:success`, `f/on:exception`:** Callbacks for handling future completion, success, or exceptions.
*   **`cc/pool`:** Manages thread pools for concurrent tasks.
*   **`cc/submit`:** Submits tasks to an executor.

```clojure
(defn submit
  "submits a task to an executor"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([^ExecutorService service ^Callable f]
   (submit service f nil)))

(defn ^CompletableFuture on:complete
  "process both the value and exception"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([^CompletableFuture future f]
   (on:complete future f {})))
```

### 6. Data Structures and Transformations

The `std.lib.collection` and `std.lib.transform` namespaces provide utilities for manipulating data structures.

*   **`merge-nested`:** Recursively merges maps.
*   **`tree-nestify`:** Nests keys in a map based on a separator.
*   **`wrap-model-pre-transform`, `wrap-model-post-transform`:** Functions for applying transformations in a data processing pipeline.

```clojure
(defn merge-nested
  "Merges nested values from left to right."
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([& maps]
   (apply merge-with (fn [& args]
                       (if (every? #(or (map? %) (nil? %)) args)
                         (apply merge-nested args)
                         (last args)))
          maps)))

(defn wrap-model-pre-transform
  "Applies a function transformation in the :pre-transform step"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([f]
   (fn [tdata tsch nsv interim fns datasource]
     (let [strans (:pre-transform interim)
           output (process-transform strans tdata nsv interim tsch datasource)]
       (f output tsch nsv (update-in interim [:ref-path]
                                     #(-> %
                                          (pop)
                                          (conj output)))
          fns datasource)))))
```

### 7. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)

The project defines several internal DSLs for specific domains.

*   **SQL Generation (`script.sql.table.select`):** Functions like `build-query-select`, `build-query-from`, `build-query-where` are used to construct SQL queries programmatically.
*   **Redis Commands (`kmi.redis`):** Macros like `flushdb`, `zscoremin`, `zscoremax` provide a Clojure-like interface to Redis commands.
*   **QML (`std.lang.model.spec-js.qml`):** Functions like `emit-qml`, `classify-container` are used to generate QML code.

```clojure
(defn sql:query
  "builds select query"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([query]
   (sql:query query common/*options*)))

(defmacro.lua flushdb
  "clears the redis db"
  {:added "4.0"}
  ([]
   (list 'redis.call "FLUSHDB")))

(defn emit-qml
  "emits a qml string"
  {:added "4.0"}
  [form grammar mopts]
  (let [tree (classify form)]
    (emit-node tree grammar mopts)))
```

### 8. Code Generation (`code.gen`)

The `code.gen` namespace provides tools for generating code from templates.

*   **`gen/template-generator`:** Creates a function that can generate code from a template file.
*   **`gen/generate`:** Generates code by applying bindings to a template.

```clojure
(def greeter-template-fn
  (gen/template-generator "resources/my/templates/def_greeter.block.clj"))

(def generated-code-list
  (f/template-entries [greeter-template-fn]
                      greeter-entries))
```

### 9. Comments and Documentation

*   **Docstrings:** All public functions must have a clear and comprehensive docstring, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return value, along with examples.
*   **Inline Comments:** Inline comments (`;`) should be used sparingly. Use them to explain *why* a particular piece of code is necessary, especially if the logic is complex. Avoid comments that simply restate what the code is doing.
*   **`^:hidden`:** Used in docstrings to indicate examples that are not meant to be displayed in generated documentation.

This comprehensive style guide aims to capture the essence of the `foundation-base` project's coding philosophy, promoting consistency, readability, and maintainability across its diverse codebase. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can contribute effectively and ensure the long-term health of the project.


## Testing Style Guide for `foundation-base`

This guide outlines the conventions and best practices for writing tests in the `foundation-base` project, based on the existing test suite.

### 1. File and Namespace Naming

*   **Test Files:** Test files should mirror the namespace of the code they are testing, with `-test` appended to the file name.
    *   *Example:* The tests for `std.lib.collection` are in `test/std/lib/collection_test.clj`.

*   **Test Namespaces:** Test namespaces should follow the same pattern as the file names, with `_test` appended to the namespace.
    *   *Example:* `std.lib.collection-test`

### 2. The `code.test` Framework

All tests in the `foundation-base` project are written using the `code.test` framework. This framework provides a set of macros and functions for defining, running, and asserting the behavior of your code.

#### 2.1. Test Structure

*   **`fact` Macro:** The primary macro for defining tests is `fact`. Each `fact` should test a single, specific piece of functionality.

*   **`^{:refer ...}` Metadata: The Cornerstone of Testability**

    It is **mandatory** for every `fact` to have `^{:refer ...}` metadata. This metadata links the test directly to the function it is testing. This is a crucial feature of the `code.test` framework for several reasons:

    *   **Traceability:** It provides a clear and explicit link between a test and the code it is testing, making it easy to understand what each test is for.
    *   **Code Coverage:** It allows for accurate tracking of test coverage, ensuring that all public functions are tested.
    *   **Maintainability:** When a function is changed or refactored, it is easy to find the corresponding tests and update them accordingly.

    ```clojure
    (ns std.lib.collection-test
      (:use code.test)
      (:require [std.lib.collection :as c]))
    
    ^{:refer std.lib.collection/map-keys :added "3.0"}
    (fact "changes the keys of a map"
      (c/map-keys inc {0 :a 1 :b 2 :c})
      => {1 :a, 2 :b, 3 :c})
    ```

#### 2.2. Scaffolding

*   **`fact:global`:** Use `fact:global` to define setup and teardown logic that should run before and after all tests in a namespace. This is the primary mechanism for scaffolding test environments.

*   **Fact-level Scaffolding:** For more granular control, you can use the `:setup` and `:teardown` keys within the `fact` metadata to define setup and teardown logic for a single fact.

    ```clojure
    ^{:refer std.lib.collection/map-keys :added "3.0"
      :setup [(println "Setting up fact")]
      :teardown [(println "Tearing down fact")]}
    (fact "demonstrates fact-level setup and teardown"
      (+ 1 1) => 2)
    ```

*   **Component Management:** `fact:global` is also used to manage test components, such as starting and stopping servers, clients, and other resources.

*   **Reusing Scaffolding:** The `:setup [(fact:global :setup)]` pattern is used to inherit and extend the setup logic from a more general `fact:global` definition. This is particularly useful for creating complex scaffolding setups.

#### 2.3. Assertions

*   **`=>` Operator:** The `=>` operator is used for assertions. The left side is the expression to be tested, and the right side is the expected result.
*   **`throws`:** To assert that an expression throws an exception, use `=> (throws)`.
*   **Checkers:** The `code.test.checker.common` namespace provides a set of checkers for more complex assertions.

```clojure
(fact "demonstrates various assertions"
  (+ 1 1) => 2

  (some? nil) => false?

  (throw (Exception. "error")) => (throws))
```

#### 2.4. Advanced Features

*   **`fact:let`:** Allows for running a test with different bindings, making it easy to test a function with various inputs.

```clojure
(fact:template "a template for testing addition"
  (fact:let [[a b c] [1 2 3]]
    (+ a b) => c))
```

*   **`fact:derive`:**  Creates a new test that inherits the setup and teardown logic from another test.

*   **`fact:template`:**  Defines a test that can be used as a template for other tests.

*   **`fact:check`:**  A macro for property-based testing, allowing you to test a function with a range of generated inputs.

*   **`fact:bench`:**  A macro for running micro-benchmarks on your code.

#### 2.5. Running Tests

*   **`executive/run-namespace`:** Runs all tests in a given namespace.
*   **`executive/run-current`:** Runs all tests in the current namespace.

#### 2.6. Debugging Tests

*   **`print/print-failure`:** Prints a detailed report of a test failure.
*   **`print/print-thrown`:** Prints a detailed report of an exception that was thrown during a test.

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing with `std.lang`

The `foundation-base` project uses a custom DSL provided by `std.lang` for writing code that can be compiled to multiple platforms (e.g., JavaScript, Lua). This DSL is also used for writing cross-platform tests.

*   **`l/script-`:** Use the `l/script-` macro to define platform-specific code and dependencies for your tests. You can have multiple `l/script-` blocks in a single test file, one for each platform you want to test against.

*   **`!.<platform>`:** Use the `!.<platform>` macro to execute a form on a specific platform. This allows you to write a single test that runs the same code on the JVM, in JavaScript, and in Lua, and asserts that the results are the same.

```clojure
(ns xt.lang.base-lib-test
  (:use code.test)
  (:require [std.lang :as l]
            [std.lib :as h]))

(l/script- :js
  {:runtime :basic
   :require [[xt.lang.base-lib :as k]]})

(l/script- :lua
  {:runtime :basic
   :require [[xt.lang.base-lib :as k]]})

(fact "identity function works on all platforms"
  (!.js (k/identity 1))
  => 1

  (!.lua (k/identity 1))
  => 1)
```

### 4. Best Practices

*   **Always use `^{:refer ...}`:** Every `fact` must have `^{:refer ...}` metadata to link it to the function it is testing.
*   **Keep tests small and focused:** Each `fact` should test a single, specific piece of functionality.
*   **Use descriptive names for tests:** The description of a `fact` should clearly explain what the test is doing.
*   **Write tests for all new code:** All new features, bug fixes, and refactorings should be accompanied by tests.
*   **Run tests often:** Run your tests frequently to catch regressions early.

By following these conventions, you will ensure that your tests are consistent with the rest of the project, easy to read, and easy to maintain.

## Function Design Guide for `foundation-base`

This guide outlines best practices and common patterns for designing functions within the `foundation-base` project, drawing examples directly from the codebase. The goal is to promote clarity, modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.

### 1. Clarity and Readability

Functions should be easy to understand at a glance. This is achieved through clear naming, comprehensive documentation, and consistent formatting.

#### 1.1. Docstrings and Metadata

Every public function must have a comprehensive docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return value. The `{:added "version"}` metadata is mandatory.

*   **Purpose:** Clearly state what the function does.
*   **Arguments:** Describe each argument, its type, and its role.
*   **Return Value:** Explain what the function returns.
*   **Examples:** Provide illustrative examples of how to use the function.
*   **Metadata:** Use `{:added "version"}` to track when the function was introduced. Other custom metadata can provide additional context.

**Example: `std.lib.collection/map-keys`**

```clojure
(defn map-keys
  "changes the keys of a map
 
   (map-keys inc {0 :a 1 :b 2 :c})
   => {1 :a, 2 :b, 3 :c}"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([f m]
   (reduce (fn [out [k v]]
             (assoc out (f k) v))
           {} 
           m)))
```

**Example: `std.lib.network/port:check-available`**

```clojure
(defn port:check-available
  "check that port is available
 
   (port:check-available 51311)
   => anything"
  {:added "4.0"}
  ([port]
   (try
     (with-open [^ServerSocket s (ServerSocket. port)]
       (.setReuseAddress s true)
       (.getLocalPort s))
     (catch Throwable t
       false))))
```

#### 1.2. Naming Conventions

*   **Public Functions:** Use `spinal-case` (e.g., `create-directory`, `process-transform`).
*   **Namespaced Functions:** Use a colon (`:`) to create "sub-namespaces" for related functions (e.g., `atom:get`, `socket:port`).
*   **Predicate Functions:** End with a question mark `?` (e.g., `component?`, `hash-map?`).
*   **Internal/Helper Functions:** Often start with a hyphen (`-`) or are not explicitly exposed (e.g., `-write-value`, `tf-macroexpand`).

#### 1.3. Arity and Parameter Order

Functions should handle multiple arities gracefully, typically with the simpler arities calling the more complex ones. Positional arguments are preferred for mandatory inputs, while optional parameters are often passed in a map.

**Example: `std.fs.api/create-directory`**

```clojure
(defn create-directory
  "creates a directory on the filesystem"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([path]
   (create-directory path {}))
  ([path attrs]
   (Files/createDirectories (path/path path)
                            (attr/map->attr-array attrs))))
```

### 2. Modularity and Single Responsibility

Functions should ideally do one thing and do it well. Complex tasks are broken down into smaller, composable functions.

**Example: `std.timeseries.compute/process-transform`**

This function focuses solely on transforming an array based on a given interval and template, delegating sub-tasks like `parse-transform-expr` and `transform-interval` to other functions.

```clojure
(defn process-transform
  "processes the transform stage"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([arr {:keys [transform template merge-fn]} type time-opts]
   (let [len (count arr)
         empty (-> template :raw :empty)
         interval (range/range-op :to interval arr time-opts)
         [tag val] interval
         arr   (case tag
                 :time   (let [{:keys [key order]} time-opts
                               {:keys [op-fn comp-fn]} (common/order-fns order)
                               start  (key (first arr))
                               steps  (quot (math/abs (- start (key (last arr))))
                                            val)
                               sorted (group-by (fn [m]
                                                  (quot (math/abs (- start (key m)))
                                                        val))
                                                arr)]
                           (mapv (fn [i] 
                                   (or (get sorted i)
                                       [(case type
                                          :map  (assoc empty key (op-fn start (* i val)))
                                          :time (op-fn start (* i val)))]))
                                 (range steps)))
                 :ratio  (let [num (math/ceil (* len val))]
                           (partition num arr))
                 :array (partition val arr))]
     (mapv merge-fn arr))))
```

### 3. Parameter Design

#### 3.1. Positional vs. Map Arguments

*   **Positional Arguments:** Used for mandatory and frequently used parameters.
*   **Map Arguments:** Preferred for optional parameters, configurations, or when there are many parameters. This improves readability and allows for easy extension.

**Example: `std.lib.future/submit`**

```clojure
(defn submit
  "submits a task to an executor"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([^ExecutorService service ^Callable f]
   (submit service f nil))
  ([^ExecutorService service f {:keys [min max delay default] :as m}]
   (let [^Callable f (cond-> f
                       min (wrap-min-time min (or delay 0)))
         opts (cond-> {:pool service}
                max     (assoc :timeout max)
                default (assoc :default default)
                delay   (assoc :delay delay))]
     (f/future:run f opts))))
```


### 4. Error Handling

Robust error handling is crucial. The `h/error` function is the standard way to throw exceptions with structured data, making debugging easier.

**Example: `std.lib.foundation/error`**

```clojure
(defmacro error
  "throws an error with message
 
   (error "Error")
   => (throws)"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([message]
   `(throw (ex-info ~message {})))
  ([message data]
   `(throw (ex-info ~message ~data))))
```

**Example: `std.lang.base.book/assert-module`**

```clojure
(defn assert-module
  "asserts that module exists"
  {:added "4.0"}
  [book module-id]
  (or (has-module? book module-id)
      (h/error "No module found." {:available (set (list-entries book :module)) 
                                   :module module-id})))
```

### 5. Immutability vs. Mutability

Clojure favors immutability, but mutable state is managed explicitly when necessary.

*   **Persistent Data Structures:** Clojure's default data structures are immutable.
*   **Atoms and Volatiles:** `atom` and `volatile!` are used for managing mutable state with clear semantics.
*   **`defmutable`:** For defining mutable data structures when performance or specific behavior requires it.

**Example: `std.lib.mutable/defmutable`**

```clojure
(defmacro defmutable
  "allows definition of a mutable datastructure"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([tp-name fields & protos] 
   {:pre [(symbol? tp-name)
         (every? symbol? fields)]} (let [fields (mapv (fn [sym] 
                       (with-meta sym 
                                  (assoc (meta sym) :volatile-mutable true)))
                     fields)]
    
    `(deftype ~tp-name ~fields 
       IMutable
       (-set [~'this ~'k ~'v] 
         (case ~'k 
           ~@(mapcat 
              (fn [x] 
                `[~(keyword (name x)) 
                  (~'set! ~x ~'v)]) 
              fields)) 
         ~'this)
       
       (-set-new [~'this ~'k ~'v] 
         (assert (not (~'k ~'this)) (str ~'k " is already set.")) 
         (case ~'k 
           ~@(mapcat 
              (fn [x] 
                `[~(keyword (name x)) 
                  (~'set! ~x ~'v)]) 
              fields)) 
         ~'this)

       (-fields [~'this] 
         ~(mapv (comp keyword name) fields))

       (-clone [~'this] 
         ~(let [cstr (symbol (str tp-name "."))] 
            `(~cstr ~@fields)))
       
       clojure.lang.ILookup 
       (~'valAt [~'this ~'k ~'default] 
         (case ~'k 
           ~@(mapcat 
               (fn [x] 
                 `[~(keyword (name x)) 
                   ~x]) 
               fields) 
           ~'default))
       (~'valAt [~'this ~'k] 
         (.valAt ~'this ~'k nil))
       ~@protos))))
```

### 6. Extensibility (Multimethods and Protocols)

Functions are often designed to be extensible, allowing new behaviors to be added without modifying existing code.

*   **`defmulti` and `defmethod`:** Used for dispatching behavior based on the type or value of arguments.
*   **Protocols (`defprotocol`, `extend-type`, `defimpl`):** Define interfaces that can be implemented by different types.

**Example: `net.http.common/-write-value` (Multimethod)**

```clojure
(defmulti -write-value
  "writes the string value of the datastructure according to format"
  {:added "0.5"}
  (fn [s format] format))

(defmethod -write-value :edn
  ([s _]
   (pr-str s)))
```

**Example: `std.lib.component/IComponent` (Protocol with `defimpl`)**

```clojure
(defimpl LuceneSearch [type instance]
  :string common/to-string
  :protocols [std.protocol.component/IComponent
              :body {-start impl/start-lucene
                     -stop  impl/stop-lucene}])
```

### 7. `std.lang` DSL Integration

Functions designed for the `std.lang` DSL have specific patterns for cross-platform compatibility and code generation.

*   **`defn.<lang>` and `defmacro.<lang>`:** Functions and macros are defined with a language-specific tag (e.g., `defn.js`, `defmacro.lua`).
*   **Cross-Platform Utilities (`xt.lang.base-lib`):** The `k/` alias is commonly used for `xt.lang.base-lib` functions, which provide platform-agnostic operations.
*   **Code Generation:** Functions often take `grammar` and `mopts` (macro options) as arguments to facilitate code generation.

**Example: `js.blessed.layout/LayoutMain` (React Component in JS DSL)**

```clojure
(defn.js LayoutMain
  "constructs the main page"
  {:added "4.0"}
  ([#{[(:= header  {:menu []
                    :toggle nil
                    :user  nil})
       (:= footer  {:menu []
                    :toggle nil})
       init
       route
       setRoute
       index
       setIndex
       sections
       status
       setStatus
       busy
       setBusy
       notify
       setNotify
       menuWidth
       menuContent
       menuFooter
       menuHide
       console
       consoleHeight]}] ; ... rest of function
```

**Example: `kmi.queue.common/mq-do-key` (Lua DSL Function)**

```clojure
(defn.lua mq-do-key
  "helper function for multi key ops"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([key f acc]
   (local k-space   (cat key ":_"))
   (local k-pattern (cat k-space ":[^\\:]+$"))
   (local k-partitions (r/scan-regex k-pattern (cat k-space ":*")))
   (k/for:array [[i pfull]  k-partitions]
     (local p (. pfull (sub (+ (len key) 4))))
     (f key p acc))
   (return acc)))
```

### 8. Higher-Order Functions and Function Composition

Functions are often designed to be composed, taking other functions as arguments or returning functions.

*   **`comp`, `partial`:** Used for creating new functions from existing ones.
*   **Threading Macros (`->`, `->>`):** Used for chaining function calls, improving readability of sequential operations.

**Example: `std.lib.transform.apply/wrap-hash-set`**

```clojure
(defn wrap-hash-set
  "allows operations to be performed on sets"
  {:added "3.0"}
  ([f]
   (fn [val datasource]
     (cond (set? val)
           (set (map #(f % datasource) val))

           :else
           (f val datasource)))))
```

### 9. Macros for Abstraction and Code Generation

Macros are used to reduce boilerplate, create DSLs, and generate code at compile time.

*   **`defmacro`:** Standard Clojure macro definition.
*   **`h/template-entries`:** A powerful macro for generating multiple definitions from a template, often used for binding external library functions or constants.

**Example: `std.lib.template/deftemplate` and `h/template-entries`**

```clojure
(deftemplate res-api-tmpl
  ([[sym res-sym config]]
   (let [extra    (count (:args config))
         args     (map :name (:args config))
         default  (:default (first (:args config)))])
   ;; ... generates def form
   ))

(h/template-entries [res-api-tmpl] 
  [[res:exists? res-access-get {:post boolean}]
   [res:set     res-access-set {:args [{:name instance}]}]])
```

This guide provides a deeper insight into the function design principles and patterns prevalent in the `foundation-base` codebase. By understanding and applying these principles, developers can contribute functions that are consistent, robust, and easily integrated into the existing architecture.
